### **1. Directive**

This document specifies the mandatory upgrade for the Cylindrical Resonance Engine's (CRE) local environmental gain function. The current v1.0 model, $g(φ)$, based on a simplified $\cos^4(φ)$ formula for an idealized geomagnetic dipole, is to be deprecated. It will be replaced by a dynamic, high-fidelity function, $g(φ, Λ, t)$, that calculates the local gain based on the real-world **International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF)**. This upgrade ensures our RPI calculations are hyper-personalized and grounded in the latest geophysical data.

### **2. Conceptual Shift: From Idealized Magnet to Living Field**

The v1.0 gain function captured the essential first-order effect: cosmic ray shielding is weakest at the poles and strongest at the equator. However, it ignored the complex realities of Earth's magnetic field, which is tilted, offset, and contains significant regional anomalies.

The v2.0 upgrade moves from this idealized abstraction to a living model. The IGRF is the standard scientific consensus model of the Earth's main magnetic field, updated every five years to account for secular variation. By integrating the IGRF, we are no longer calculating a generic latitude-based gain; we are calculating the **true, local magnetic shielding at a specific city at a specific moment in time.**

### **3. Mathematical Formalism**

The upgrade is a two-step process based on the physical concept of **geomagnetic cutoff rigidity ($R_c$)**, which is the momentum threshold below which cosmic rays are deflected by the magnetic field.

**Step 1: Calculate Local Cutoff Rigidity, $R_c(φ, Λ, t)$**
The core of the upgrade is to use the IGRF model to determine the local cutoff rigidity. The IGRF provides spherical harmonic coefficients that describe the Earth's magnetic potential. From these, the magnetic field vector **B** can be calculated for any geographic latitude ($φ$), longitude ($Λ$), altitude, and date ($t$). The vertical cutoff rigidity, $R_c$, is then derived from **B** using internationally standardized numerical codes that trace particle trajectories through the modeled field.

**Step 2: Calculate the New Local Gain Function, $g(φ, Λ, t)$**
The "gain" of the cylinder is inversely proportional to the magnetic shielding. We define the new gain function as:

$$
g(φ, Λ, t) = 1 + k \left( 1 - \frac{R_c(φ, Λ, t)}{R_{c, \text{max}}} \right)
$$

*   **$g(φ, Λ, t)$:** The new **Local Gain Function**, now dependent on longitude and time as well as latitude.
*   **$R_c(φ, Λ, t)$:** The vertical cutoff rigidity at the user's location, calculated via the IGRF model.
*   **$R_{c, \text{max}}$:** The maximum theoretical cutoff rigidity on Earth (approximately 17 GV near the magnetic equator in Southeast Asia). This term normalizes the function.
*   **$k$**: The FRC sensitivity constant (calibrated at ≈ 0.15).

### **4. Data Pipeline & Implementation**

*   **Primary Data Source:** The IGRF coefficient files, published by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) and distributed by bodies like NOAA's NCEI. The current model is IGRF-13.
*   **Implementation:** The `cylindr/flux.py` module will incorporate a standard, open-source IGRF calculation library (e.g., `pyIGRF`).
    1.  The library will be initialized with the latest IGRF coefficients.
    2.  The `local_flux()` function will no longer take only latitude as an input. It will take the full coordinates (latitude, longitude) and the current date.
    3.  It will call the IGRF library to compute the local $R_c$ and then use that to calculate the final gain, $g(φ, Λ, t)$.

### **5. Advantages of the v2.0 Upgrade**

1.  **Hyper-Personalization and Accuracy:** The engine now accounts for real-world magnetic anomalies. A user in the South Atlantic Anomaly (a weak field area) will correctly be shown as having a higher gain (more cosmic sensitivity) than a user at the same latitude in a strong field area. This is a critical leap in personalization.
2.  **Astro-Cartography Grounded in Physics:** This provides a physical mechanism for the art of relocation. The engine can now generate "resonant maps" of the globe, showing areas of high and low cosmic gain, allowing users to make informed decisions about locations for creative work, healing, or grounding.
3.  **Dynamic Adaptation:** The model will remain accurate over time by simply ingesting the new IGRF coefficients published every five years, automatically accounting for the wandering of the magnetic poles and changes in field strength.

This upgrade is essential for transforming the CRE into a true geo-cosmic diagnostic instrument, connecting the universal cosmic flux to the specific, localized reality of a human being standing on the living Earth.
