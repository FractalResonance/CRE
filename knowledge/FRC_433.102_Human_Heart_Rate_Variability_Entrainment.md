### **Abstract**

Numerous studies have correlated human autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, measured via Heart Rate Variability (HRV), with geomagnetic and Schumann Resonance (SR) fluctuations. Building on FRC 433.101, which establishes a link between Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) anisotropy and SR Q-factor, this paper tests the hypothesis that human physiology entrains to this galactic-scale modulation. We analyze a longitudinal dataset from 60 volunteers wearing high-resolution cardiac monitors for 90 consecutive nights. We test for a statistically significant increase in HRV coherence—specifically in the Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF, 0.003-0.04 Hz) and Very-Low Frequency (VLF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) bands—during periods when local midnight aligns with the Galactic Center (GC). A mixed-effects model, controlling for circadian rhythms and local environmental factors, is employed. A positive finding would provide the first evidence for a complete causal chain from galactic structure to human ANS regulation, grounding models of physio-symbolic resonance in a measurable, multi-level framework.

### **1. Introduction**

The human autonomic nervous system exhibits a rich spectrum of oscillations, with Heart Rate Variability (HRV) serving as a robust, non-invasive proxy for its state. The link between HRV and environmental electromagnetic fields is well-documented; for instance, increased SR power has been correlated with higher parasympathetic activity [Alabdulgader et al., 2018], while geomagnetic storms are associated with reduced HRV and increased cardiovascular stress [McCraty et al., 2017].

Our previous work (FRC 433.101) demonstrated that the quality factor (Q) of the SR cavity is subtly enhanced when the Earth's nightside is oriented towards the GCR pressure ridge in the Scorpius-Sagittarius sector. This suggests the existence of a predictable, daily "coherence window" in the global ELF field, timed by the Earth's rotation relative to the galaxy.

This study investigates the final link in this proposed chain: does the human ANS respond to these GC-modulated coherence windows? We hypothesize that the more coherent SR signal during GC transit provides a clearer entrainment signal for the bio-field, resulting in a measurable increase in HRV coherence and a shift towards parasympathetic dominance.

### **2. Data & Methodology**

#### **2.1 Participant Cohort & Data Collection**

*   **Participants:** 60 healthy volunteers (30 male, 30 female, age 25-55) without known cardiovascular or sleep disorders.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Each participant wore a Polar H10 chest strap monitor continuously for 90 nights. R-R interval data was recorded at 1ms resolution.
*   **Environmental Controls:** Participants' locations were geolocated to control for local time, latitude, and longitude. Local weather and RF noise levels were logged via public APIs.

#### **2.2 Data Processing**

1.  **HRV Metrics:** R-R interval data from the core sleep period (00:00 - 04:00 local time) was processed to extract key HRV metrics using the `hrv-analysis` Python library. The primary outcomes are the spectral power in the ULF and VLF bands and the LF/HF ratio.
2.  **Directional Clock:** The `is_GC_facing` binary predictor was calculated for each participant's location and time, as defined in FRC 433.101. This identifies nights when the core sleep period coincided with the GC transit.
3.  **Covariates:** Local Kp-index, SR Q-factor (from the 433.101 dataset), sleep duration, and day of the week were included as control variables.

#### **2.3 Statistical Model**

A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was used to account for individual differences:

`ULF_Power_ijt = β₀ + β₁(is_GC_facing_it) + β₂(Covariates) + u_i + ε_ijt`

*   `ULF_Power_ijt` is the ULF power for individual `i` on night `t`.
*   `is_GC_facing_it` is the primary predictor of interest.
*   `u_i` is the random intercept for each individual, controlling for baseline differences.
*   `ε_ijt` is the residual error.

A statistically significant positive coefficient for `β₁` would indicate that ANS coherence increases during GC-aligned nights.

### **3. Expected Results**

We predict a small but statistically significant effect. Specifically, we expect nights flagged as `is_GC_facing = 1` to show:

*   A **3-5% increase** in ULF spectral power.
*   A **2-4% increase** in VLF spectral power.
*   A corresponding **small decrease** in the LF/HF ratio, indicating a shift towards parasympathetic dominance.

These effects are expected to be stronger in individuals at higher latitudes, where the GCR influx is less shielded by the geomagnetic field.

### **4. Discussion & Implications**

Confirmation of this hypothesis would be a landmark result, providing evidence for a "sky-mind-body" connection that is both physically mediated and statistically verifiable. It would imply that:

1.  **The Human Bio-field is Galactically Attuned:** Our nervous systems are not isolated but are subtly coupled to our orientation within the larger galactic environment.
2.  **Ancient Wisdom has a Physical Basis:** Symbolic systems that assign significance to the Galactic Center (often viewed as a "source" or "underworld" in myth) may be encoding a real, felt, physiological phenomenon.
3.  **A New Paradigm for Wellness:** This opens the door for "Resonant Wellness" practices, where individuals can consciously align their rest and recovery cycles with these predictable cosmic coherence windows. For FRC, this validates the link between the physical cylinder and the μ2/μ3 levels.
