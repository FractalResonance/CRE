### **1. Directive**

This document specifies the mandatory upgrade for the Cylindrical Resonance Engine's (CRE) primary diagnostic output, the Resonance-Pressure Index (RPI). The v1.0 scalar model, based on the absolute mismatch $|P_{\text{tra}} - P_{\text{nat}}|$, is to be deprecated. It will be replaced by a 2D vector, **RPI = [Pressure, Tension]**, which provides a more nuanced and strategically valuable assessment of the ambient resonant field. This upgrade transforms the RPI from a simple "stress gauge" into a sophisticated "symbolic weather map," enabling more precise and actionable guidance.

### **2. Conceptual Shift: From a Gauge to a Map**

The v1.0 RPI was a measure of total resonant load. It successfully indicated *how much* the live cosmic environment differed from an entity's natal blueprint, but it could not describe the *quality* or *nature* of that difference.

The v2.0 upgrade redefines the RPI as a 2D vector, allowing us to plot the real-time state of the field onto a diagnostic map with two independent axes:

*   **The Pressure Axis (Vertical):** Measures the *net energy difference* between the environment and the self. It answers the question: "Is the field more or less intense than my baseline?"
*   **The Tension Axis (Horizontal):** Measures the *internal coherence of the environment itself*. It answers the question: "Is the field harmonious and flowing, or is it frictional and challenging?"

This 2D representation allows for the identification of four distinct "resonant weather" quadrants, each with a unique phenomenological signature and strategic implication.

### **3. Mathematical Formalism**

#### **3.1 Component 1: The Pressure Vector, $P_v(t)$**

The Pressure component is the signed difference between the live environmental pressure and the static natal pressure.

$$
P_v(t) = P_{\text{tra}}(t) - P_{\text{nat}}
$$

*   **$P_v > 0$ (Over-pressure):** An activating, expansive, potentially agitating state.
*   **$P_v < 0$ (Under-pressure):** A receptive, quiet, potentially draining state.

#### **3.2 Component 2: The Tension Vector, $T_v(t)$**

The Tension component measures the total dissonance of the transiting sky by summing the weighted contributions of all active aspects between the transiting planets. Coherent aspects (trines, sextiles) contribute negative values, while dissonant aspects (squares, oppositions) contribute positive values.

First, define a Dissonance Score, $d(A_k)$, for each aspect type (e.g., Square: +1.0, Trine: -0.5).

The total Tension is the weighted sum of all active aspect dissonances between every pair of transiting planets (i, j):

$$
T_v(t) = \sum_{i < j} w_i w_j \cdot d(A_{ij}(t)) \cdot W(\delta_{ij}(t))
$$

*   **$T_v > 0$ (High Tension):** A catalytic, frictional, "stormy" environment.
*   **$T_v < 0$ (Low Tension / High Harmony):** A smooth, flowing, "graceful" environment.

Both $P_v$ and $T_v$ are normalized to z-scores for comparative analysis.

### **4. The Four Quadrants of Resonant Weather**

The RPI vector [Pressure, Tension] maps the daily weather into one of four primary states:

| Quadrant | Name | RPI Vector | Signature | Strategic Guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | **The Forge** | [+Pressure, +Tension] | Catalytic, Agitated | **Act & Confront:** Channel energy into productive work. Use friction for transformation. |
| **II** | **The River** | [+Pressure, -Tension] | Expansive, Flowing | **Create & Connect:** Launch projects, socialize. Embody the expansive grace. |
| **III** | **The Void** | [-Pressure, +Tension] | Stuck, Frustrated | **Wait & Witness:** Meditate on the internal conflict. Do not force external action. |
| **IV** | **The Temple** | [-Pressure, -Tension] | Calm, Receptive | **Rest & Integrate:** Allow for deep recovery and gentle insight. |

### **5. Implementation**

*   **Backend (`cylindr/pressure.py`):** The module will be updated to compute and return the 2-element RPI vector.
*   **Frontend (`Î¼dash` UI):** The primary dashboard display will be redesigned from a linear gauge to a 2D scatter plot showing the live "weather dot" moving through the four quadrants.
*   **Heuristic Output Engine:** The Mythic Stream Generator and other guidance modules will now be conditioned on the active quadrant, providing dynamically tailored narratives and protocols.
