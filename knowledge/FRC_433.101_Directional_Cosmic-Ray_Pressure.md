### **Abstract**

The Earth-ionosphere cavity's Schumann Resonances (SR) are known to fluctuate with global lightning activity and solar-driven ionospheric changes. This paper investigates an additional, previously unquantified driver: anisotropic pressure from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). Full-sky GCR maps at TeV energies reveal a persistent intensity excess from the Scorpius-Sagittarius sector, aligned with the Galactic Center. We hypothesize that this directional pressure systematically modulates the D-region ionosphere, resulting in a measurable increase in the SR modal Q-factors when a monitoring station's local midnight faces this "pressure ridge." We analyze five years of continuous ELF data from four mid-latitude observatories, cross-correlating SR Q-factors with GCR anisotropy indices derived from neutron monitor and muon detector networks. A generalized additive model, controlling for lightning and solar wind covariates, is used to test for a statistically significant Q-factor enhancement during Galactic Center transit. Verifying this link would establish a novel causal pathway from large-scale galactic structure to the planet's baseline electromagnetic environment, providing a physical foundation for models of geo-cosmic-biological coupling.

### **1. Introduction**

The Schumann Resonances (SR) are a set of global electromagnetic standing waves in the cavity formed by the Earth's surface and the ionosphere. The modal frequencies (≈ 7.8, 14.3, 20.8 Hz) and their quality factors (Q-factors) are sensitive probes of global atmospheric and ionospheric conditions. While the primary driver is global thunderstorm activity, significant perturbations are known to be caused by solar events such as X-ray flares and solar proton events, which alter D-region conductivity [Sátori et al., 2016].

Concurrently, independent astrophysical observations have established a stable, large-scale anisotropy in the arrival directions of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) at TeV energies. Data from the IceCube, HAWC, and Tibet ASγ experiments reveal a persistent GCR excess of amplitude ΔI/I ≈ 10⁻³ originating from a broad region that includes the Galactic Center (GC) [Ahlers & Mertsch, 2017]. It is understood that the interstellar magnetic field drapes over the heliosphere, creating a "pressure wall" that is more pronounced on the heliosphere's GC-facing "nose."

We propose to connect these two phenomena. We hypothesize that the enhanced GCR flux from the GC sector creates a persistent, subtle increase in D-region ionization on the Earth's nightside when it is oriented toward this directional source. This should, in turn, reduce the cavity's energy loss in that sector, resulting in a small but measurable increase in the global SR Q-factors. This paper presents the first systematic, multi-site study to test this directional coupling.

### **2. Data & Methodology**

#### **2.1 Data Streams (2019-2024)**

| Data Stream | Source(s) | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ELF Magnetic Spectra | Moshiri (JP), Nagycenk (HU), Polgárdi (HU), Maitri (ZA) | 10 s FFT |
| Lightning Proxy | World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) | 5 min flash counts |
| Solar Wind & Kp | OMNI 1-min (NASA) | 1 min |
| GCR Anisotropy Index | Oulu & South Pole Neutron Monitors; HAWC & IceCube maps | Hourly / Seasonal |

#### **2.2 Methodology**

1.  **SR Q-Factor Extraction:** For each station, the power spectral density is computed. The first two SR modes (f₁ ≈ 7.8 Hz, f₂ ≈ 14.3 Hz) are fitted with a Lorentzian function to extract the instantaneous Q-factor (Q = f/Δf) for each 10-minute interval.
2.  **Directional Clock:** For each station, the local sidereal time (LST) is calculated. We define a binary predictor, `is_GC_facing`, which is set to 1 when the Galactic Center (RA ≈ 17h 45m) is within ±2 hours of the local meridian (i.e., local midnight is facing the GC pressure ridge).
3.  **Statistical Model:** A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is used to isolate the directional effect:

    `log(Q_it) = β₀ + β₁(is_GC_facing_it) + s(Lightning_it) + s(SolarWind_it) + s(Kp_it) + ε_it`

    where `s()` represents a smoothing spline to control for the non-linear effects of the covariates. A statistically significant positive coefficient for `β₁` would support our hypothesis.

### **3. Expected Results**

Based on preliminary analysis and known GCR-ionosphere interaction models, we predict a small but robust effect. We expect the `β₁` coefficient to be positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01 after Bonferroni correction for multiple sites/modes), corresponding to an average Q-factor increase of **1-3%** during GC-facing periods.

### **4. Discussion & Implications**

A positive result would represent a significant paradigm shift, establishing that the Earth's resonant environment is not just a product of solar-terrestrial dynamics, but is also subtly modulated by our orientation within the larger galactic structure. This finding would:

1.  Provide the first empirical evidence linking the stable, large-scale GCR anisotropy to a continuous geophysical variable.
2.  Add a new, predictable variable to models of ionospheric conductivity and SR behavior.
3.  Ground theories of bio-electromagnetic entrainment in a larger cosmic context, providing a plausible physical mechanism for observed correlations between human physiology (e.g., HRV) and galactic-scale phenomena. For the FRC framework, this would validate the physical basis of the "Cosmic Flux Map."

A null result would constrain the magnitude of GCR influence on the D-region, suggesting that its ionization effects are negligible compared to solar and terrestrial drivers.
