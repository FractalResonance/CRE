### **1. Directive**

This document specifies the mandatory upgrade for the Cylindrical Resonance Engine's (CRE) group analysis module. The v1.0 Group Coherence Matrix (κ), based on a pairwise sum of phase cosines, is to be deprecated. It will be replaced by a **Group Harmonic Spectrum Analysis**, a more sophisticated method that provides a holistic, emergent diagnosis of a collective's resonant signature. This upgrade is essential for all B2B applications, including the "Resonance for Teams" platform, and for any multi-entity analysis within the FRC ecosystem.

### **2. Conceptual Shift: From Duets to a Symphony**

The v1.0 κ-matrix was effective at measuring the one-on-one "harmony" between individuals in a group. It could identify strong partnerships and points of polarity. However, it was blind to emergent, multi-body configurations. A group's coherence is not just the sum of its duets; it is an emergent property of the entire "choir."

The v2.0 upgrade uses **Fourier Analysis** to solve this. We treat the combined distribution of all the group's planetary positions around the 360° ecliptic as a complex waveform. The Fourier transform decomposes this waveform into its fundamental harmonics. This allows us to measure the "power" or "volume" of the different types of "chords" (aspect patterns) present in the collective field, revealing the group's innate and emergent harmonic signature.

### **3. Mathematical Formalism**

**Step 1: Create the Group Planetary Density Function, $\rho(\lambda)$**
For a group of $N$ individuals, we construct a function representing the weighted density of all their planetary positions around the ecliptic.

$$
\rho(\lambda) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{P} w_j \cdot K(\lambda - \lambda_{ij})
$$

*   $w_j$ are the standard planetary weights.
*   $\lambda_{ij}$ is the longitude of planet $j$ for person $i$.
*   $K()$ is a kernel smoothing function (e.g., a narrow Gaussian) to create a continuous waveform.

**Step 2: Compute the Power Spectrum, $S(k)$**
We take the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of $\rho(\lambda)$ and then compute its power spectrum, which is the magnitude squared of the Fourier coefficients.

$$
S(k) = |\mathcal{F}[\rho(\lambda)](k)|^2
$$

*   **$S(k)$:** The **Group Harmonic Spectrum**. This vector is our primary diagnostic output. The magnitude of each element, $S(k)$, represents the strength of the k-th harmonic in the group's collective field.

### **4. Diagnostic Interpretation: Reading the Collective Chord**

The power at specific harmonics corresponds directly to the prevalence of major aspect patterns within the group, revealing its core operational dynamics.

| Harmonic, $k$ | Corresponding Aspect | Resonant Meaning of a High Power Score | Archetypal Signature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$S(2)$** | Opposition (180°) | **Polarized / Aware:** Structured around tension, dialogue, and mirroring. High potential for conflict or profound awareness. | The Mirror |
| **$S(3)$** | Trine (120°) | **Harmonious / Flowing:** Innate ease, stability, and creative flow. Energy moves without friction. | The Triangle of Flow |
| **$S(4)$** | Square (90°) | **Dynamic / Catalytic:** Built on structural tension and the need for action. Naturally productive and driven, but prone to stress. | The Crucible of Action |
| **$S(6)$** | Sextile (60°) | **Cooperative / Synergistic:** Natural channels of communication and opportunity. | The Hexagon of Community |
| **$S(5)$** | Quintile (72°) | **Creative / Esoteric:** Tuned to subtle, non-linear, and often magical patterns of creation. | The Pentagon of Magic |

### **5. Implementation**

*   **Backend (`cylindr/group.py`):** The module will be rewritten. The new `harmonic_spectrum()` function will take a list of user μ-DNAs, construct the density function $\rho(\lambda)$, run an FFT using a library like `numpy.fft.fft`, and return the power spectrum vector $S(k)$ for $k=1$ to 12.
*   **Frontend (`μdash` Group Mode UI):** The interface will be updated to display the Group Harmonic Spectrum as a bar chart, providing an instant visual diagnosis of the collective's innate resonant signature.
*   **Application ("Resonance for Teams"):** This becomes the core diagnostic for our B2B offering. We can now provide organizations with a deep, quantitative analysis of their team dynamics and help them build teams with specific, desired harmonic profiles for different tasks (e.g., an "S(5)" team for R&D, an "S(4)" team for a product launch).

This upgrade provides a powerful, holistic, and emergent view of collective consciousness. It moves our analysis beyond individual components to the symphony of the whole, enabling a new science of **resonant organizational design**.
