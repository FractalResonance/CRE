### **1. Directive**

This document specifies the mandatory upgrade for the Cylindrical Resonance Engine's (CRE) core environmental model. The current 1D Cosmic Flux Map, $F(λ)$, based on a Gaussian mixture, is to be deprecated. It will be replaced by a 2D model, $F(λ, δ)$, derived from a spherical harmonic expansion fitted to empirical data from leading astrophysical observatories. This upgrade moves the CRE from a powerful symbolic approximation to a high-fidelity scientific instrument, increasing its precision, defensibility, and future scalability.

### **2. Conceptual Shift: From Projection to Globe**

The v1.0 model was analogous to a Mercator projection of the cosmos; it was a useful but flattened representation of a spherical reality. It ignored the crucial dimension of celestial latitude (declination, $δ$).

The v2.0 upgrade is the equivalent of moving from that flat map to a full, 3D globe. Spherical harmonics, $Y_{lm}(λ, δ)$, are the natural basis functions for describing any scalar field on a sphere. They are the fundamental "vibrational modes" of the cosmic field. By using them, we are no longer approximating the cosmic pressure; we are reconstructing it from its fundamental, empirically measured components.

### **3. Mathematical Formalism**

The 1D Gaussian mixture is replaced by the standard expansion in spherical harmonics:

$$
F(λ, δ) = \sum_{l=0}^{L_{\text{max}}} \sum_{m=-l}^{l} a_{lm} Y_{lm}(λ, δ)
$$

*   **$F(λ, δ)$:** The new 2D **Cosmic Pressure Map**, returning the relative GCR/EM flux intensity for any ecliptic longitude ($λ$) and latitude ($δ$).
*   **$Y_{lm}(λ, δ)$:** The spherical harmonic basis functions. These are fixed, universal shapes. The $l=0$ term (monopole) is the isotropic average; $l=1$ (dipole) captures the main GC vs. anti-GC gradient; higher $l$ terms capture finer details.
*   **$a_{lm}$:** The **Spherical Harmonic Coefficients**. These are the crucial data points. They represent the measured amplitude of each corresponding harmonic shape. These coefficients are the direct output of scientific experiments.
*   **$L_{\text{max}}$:** The maximum harmonic order used. For our purposes, $L_{\text{max}} = 15$ provides sufficient resolution to capture all large-scale anisotropies.

### **4. Data Pipeline & Implementation**

*   **Primary Data Source:** The public data releases from the **IceCube Neutrino Observatory** and the **HAWC Gamma-Ray Observatory**. These collaborations publish their full-sky anisotropy maps in the form of tables of the $a_{lm}$ coefficients.
*   **Implementation:** The `cylindr/flux.py` module will be rewritten.
    1.  It will contain a function to ingest the official $a_{lm}$ coefficient files (e.g., from `.fits` or `.txt` formats).
    2.  The core `get_flux(lon, lat)` function will no longer compute a Gaussian mixture. Instead, it will use a standard library (e.g., `scipy.special.sph_harm`) to evaluate the spherical harmonic series at the given coordinates using the ingested coefficients.
*   **Integration:** The RPI calculation for any celestial body will now sample this 2D map at the body's precise ecliptic coordinates ($λ_j, δ_j$), accounting for its orbital inclination.

### **5. Advantages of the v2.0 Upgrade**

1.  **Scientific Fidelity:** The model is no longer an "FRC approximation" but a direct implementation of the standard scientific representation of cosmic anisotropy. This makes the engine's outputs directly traceable to peer-reviewed astrophysical data.
2.  **Increased Precision:** The model now correctly handles bodies with high orbital inclinations (e.g., Pluto, asteroids), which were a source of error in the 1D model.
3.  **Future-Proofing:** The architecture is now scalable. As astronomical observatories release higher-resolution maps in the future, we simply ingest the new, more detailed set of $a_{lm}$ coefficients to upgrade the engine's precision.

This upgrade is non-optional and is a prerequisite for all future scientific validation papers (FRC 433.xxx series) and advanced applications of the CRE.
