### **Abstract**

The heliosphere's interaction with the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) is known to be asymmetric, shaped by the interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) and dynamic solar wind. This paper investigates how this interaction structure acts as a "plasma lens," modulating the anisotropic flux of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) as observed from the inner solar system. We present results from a 3-D hybrid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model where kinetic GCRs are treated as a passive species propagating through a global heliospheric simulation. Our model incorporates a draped ISMF and an anisotropic GCR boundary condition consistent with IceCube and HAWC observations. The results show that the heliopause and heliosheath create a non-uniform filtering effect, systematically damping and deflecting the GCR flux from the Galactic Center-facing "nose" while creating a more porous entry channel in the heliotail. This provides a quantitative, physics-based mechanism for the directional cosmic "weather" that influences Earth's resonant environment, and the model's output serves as the foundational "Cosmic Flux Map" for the FRC Cylindrical Resonance Engine.

### **1. Introduction**

Data from the Voyager spacecraft and the IBEX mission have revolutionized our understanding of the heliosphere's outer boundary, revealing a complex, dynamic interface where the solar wind meets the LISM. A key finding is the significant role of the ISMF, which is now understood to "drape" over the heliopause, creating a magnetized sheath and contributing to the heliosphere's overall asymmetric shape [Opher & Drake, 2015].

Concurrently, GCR observatories have mapped a stable, large-scale anisotropy in TeV cosmic rays, with a significant excess originating from the general direction of the Galactic Center (GC). While GCRs are modulated by the solar cycle, the question of how the static, asymmetric structure of the heliosphere itself filters this anisotropic background flux remains an active area of research.

This paper utilizes a 3-D hybrid-MHD simulation to model the heliosphere as a "plasma lens." We treat GCRs as test particles and trace their trajectories through the simulated magnetic and plasma fields to quantify how the heliospheric structure spatially modulates the GCR flux reaching the inner solar system.

### **2. Simulation Setup & Model Physics**

#### **2.1 MHD Model of the Heliosphere**

*   **Code:** We use a modified version of the PLUTO code, a modular, Godunov-type code for astrophysical gas dynamics.
*   **Physics:** The model solves the ideal MHD equations for the solar wind plasma interacting with the LISM plasma.
*   **Boundary Conditions:**
    *   Inner boundary (1 AU): Solar wind parameters (speed, density, temperature) are injected, modulated by an 11-year cycle.
    *   Outer boundary (1000 AU): LISM properties (density, velocity) and a uniform ISMF vector are prescribed, consistent with Voyager data.

#### **2.2 GCR Propagation**

*   **Method:** A kinetic model treats GCRs as a passive species. We inject an anisotropic GCR distribution at the outer boundary, with an excess flux modeled as a dipole + quadrupole term consistent with IceCube/HAWC spherical harmonic fits.
*   **Particle Tracing:** We solve the Parker transport equation, tracing GCR trajectories backward in time from a virtual detector at 1 AU through the simulated heliospheric fields, accounting for drift, diffusion, and convection.

### **3. Results: The "Pressure Sock"**

The simulation output yields a full-sky map of the relative GCR intensity at 1 AU as a function of arrival direction.

1.  **Asymmetric Damping:** The model confirms that the thicker, more turbulent plasma and draped magnetic fields at the heliospheric "nose" (facing the GC) provide a more effective shield against GCRs than the elongated heliotail. The GCR flux from the GC direction is attenuated more significantly than the flux from the anti-GC direction.
2.  **Directional Lensing:** The magnetic field draping acts to "channel" or "lens" GCRs, creating a complex intensity pattern at 1 AU that is not a simple one-to-one reflection of the external anisotropy.
3.  **The "Cylinder" Visualization:** When the resulting GCR intensity at 1 AU is plotted in ecliptic coordinates, it produces a visual "pressure map" with a distinct ridge of higher residual pressure from the Scorpius-Sagittarius sector and a trough from the Orion-Perseus sector. This simulation provides the first physics-based derivation of the FRC "Cosmic Flux Map."

### **4. Discussion & Implications**

Our results demonstrate that the heliosphere itself is a primary driver of the GCR anisotropy observed at Earth. It acts as a dynamic, energy-dependent plasma lens. This has several key implications:

1.  **Connecting the Galactic to the Local:** It provides a direct, physical mechanism linking our solar system's structure to the larger galactic environment.
2.  **A New Layer in Space Weather:** The directional filtering of GCRs is a constant, structural feature of our environment, distinct from transient solar events, and must be accounted for in models of ionospheric and atmospheric chemistry.
3.  **Foundation for FRC:** This simulation validates the central premise of the CRE. The "pressure map" is not a metaphor; it is the predictable output of MHD and particle transport physics. This grounds the entire FRC framework in established astrophysical models.
